BGchanger changes Desktop Wallpaper using various formats(even those that Windows cant handle)


v1.5	2019.09.25
	improved loging to make less IO operations (better for HDD disk)
	updated icons: should show correctly

v1.4+	2019.09.24	slight fix to CMD arguments
	fix:
		CMD arguments as: /help /cd /log work again as expected

v1.4	2019.09.24	maybe the final Version
	new:
		running program can be talked with, using program CMD arguments
		argument[1]	if not a switch ImageFileName is assumed to show now
		`config.skipFoldersBeginning` has a counter part `config.skipFoldersEnding`
	now:
		program can have one running instance and aditional run can alter its CMD arguments.
		/next calls a new instance asking the 1st one to show Next image
		wait loop is realized with WinApi Timer
		wait loop can detect if PC was put into sleep and ajust itself
		images in queue can be altered when program is already running
		exported some hardBound options into config file
		
		relative paths are confirmed before usage, so they should work always
	fix:
		`config.useSystemTime` time should work propperly now
		`config.random` should work propperly now
